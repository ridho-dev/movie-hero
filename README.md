# Movie Hero
This is my personal web project that shows movie lists. Its uploaded already, you can check it in https://moviehero.netlify.app/

I took the movies data from https://www.themoviedb.org/ API

This is an PWA with some features:
- Installable 
- Shows several categories of movies such as most popular, currently playing, and upcoming movies
- Shows the detail of the movie
- User can add one or more movies to the list of favorite movies by pressing the "love" button on the detail page

For this website I use:
- HTML, CSS, Js
- Jquery
- NPM 
- GSAP for animation
- Compression plugins for improving web performance
- All other packages I use you can see it at package.json
